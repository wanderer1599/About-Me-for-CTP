  <p id="about-me"> My name is Yevgeniy Kizhner. I am currently a <strong>senior</strong> at <em>Brooklyn College</em> majoring in Information Systems.
    I have chosen this major because I <font color="red"><strong>love</strong></font> computer programming and this major would make a "good" amount of money.
    I have been programming for a while now.
    
    Some projects I have worked on are a <em><strong>Shopping Cart</strong></em> program and <em><strong>TileVania</strong></em> video game.
