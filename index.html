  <p id="about-me"> My name is Yevgeniy Kizhner. I am currently a <strong>senior</strong> at <em>Brooklyn College</em> majoring in Information Systems.
    I have chosen this major because I <font color="red"><strong>love</strong></font> computer programming and this major would make a "good" amount of money.
    I have been programming for a while now.
    
     </p>
    
    <p id="experience"> Some projects I have worked on are a <em><strong>Shopping Cart</strong></em> program and <em><strong>TileVania</strong></em> video game.
  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I know a lot about the Java and C# programming languages and have used them a lot. I also know Game Design.
  </p>
  
  <p>One of the game projects I am currently working on is Battle Inc:
